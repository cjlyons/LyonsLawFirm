The same method works when adding up the first n numbers, with the total always being n(n+1)/2.</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 2:</strong></h4>\n<p>December 6th marked my birthday and to celebrate I travelled to Kiev with 4 friends.

Melting at a rate of 0.01 m\u00b3 per minute means the snowman will be gone after only 82\u00a0minutes!</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 4:</strong></h4>\n<p>Suppose a newly-born pair of elves, one male, one female, are living together at the North pole. Elves are able to mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second month a female elf can produce another pair of offspring. Suppose that the elves never die, and that the female always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the start of the third month on. After one year, how many pairs of elves will there\u00a0be?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Illustration of elves in tree shape.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*sTx5giObwGzQ1SoqaT-P5Q.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Answer:</strong></h4>\n<p>This problem is actually a very famous sequence in disguise\u2026</p>\n<p>The first new pair is born at the start of the third month giving 2 pairs after three months. The question tells us that we have to wait one whole month before the new offspring can mate and so only the original pair can give birth during the fourth month which leaves a total of 3 pairs after four months. For the fifth month, both the original pair, and the first-born pair can now produce offspring and so we get two more pairs giving a total of 5 after five months. In month six, the second-born pair can now also produce offspring and so in total we have three offspring-producing pairs, giving 8 pairs after 6\u00a0months.</p>\n<p>At this point, you may have spotted that the numbers follow the Fibonacci sequence, which is created by adding the previous two numbers together to get the next one along. The first twelve numbers in the sequence are below, which gives an answer of 144\u200a\u2014\u200ano wonder Santa is able to make so many\u00a0toys!</p>\n<p>Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,\u00a0\u2026</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 5:</strong></h4>\n<p>On Christmas day I have 11 people coming to dinner and so I\u2019m working on the seating plan ahead of time.

(read as 12 factorial) in total. BUT for any given seating plan we can rotate around the table one place to get the same order, which means we have in fact over counted by a factor of 12. Therefore, the total number is 11! = 39,916,800.</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 6:</strong></h4>\n<p>My front yard is covered in snow and I need to clear a path connecting my front door to the pavement and then back to the centre of the garage.

Assuming time stands still whilst he is travelling, how long can he spend in each\u00a0country?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Illustration of Santa and globe.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*fzGGB8XMlE_wF4nzUaCDYQ.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Answer:</strong></h4>\n<p>Using the UN list of 193 countries, Santa has 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes total, which means spending only 7.5 minutes in each\u00a0country!</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 10:</strong></h4>\n<p>I got carried away with buying presents this year and now have more than can fit into my stocking. If the stocking has a maximum capacity of 150, and my presents have the following sizes: 16, 27, 37, 65, 52, 42, 95, 59; what is the closest I can get to filling the stocking completely?</p>\n<p>(NB: I am not looking for the highest number of presents that will fit, but the largest total that is less than or equal to\u00a0150).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Christmas stocking.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ifv0lorr0Uv0_bAz1oeDwA.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Answer:</strong></h4>\n<p>150 exactly with 16 + 27 + 42 + 65 =\u00a0150.</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 11:</strong></h4>\n<p>Santa has 8 reindeer, and each one can pull a weight of 80kg. If Santa weighs 90kg, his sleigh 180kg, and each present weighs at least 3kg, what is the maximum number of presents that can be carried in a single\u00a0trip?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Reindeer in the snow.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*GEtQHCTxR5uWUdAbivm41Q.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Answer:</strong></h4>\n<p>We have 8 reindeer each with a capacity of 80kg giving a total of 640kg that can be carried. Subtracting the 90kg for Santa and 180kg for the sleigh leaves 370kg available. Dividing this by 3 gives 123.33 so a maximum of 123 presents can be carried at\u00a0once.</p>\n<h4><strong>Puzzle 12:</strong></h4>\n<p>To mark the end of the 12 days of Christmas each student at the University of Oxford has kindly decided to donate some money to a charity of their choice. If the first person donates \u00a312 and everyone after donates exactly half the amount of the person before them (rounding down to the nearest penny), how much will be donated in\u00a0total?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Hands holding coins\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ZY8e7o-v4mo970KuC3j1mg.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Answer:</strong></h4>\n<p>12 + 6 + 3 + 1.5 + 0.75 + 0.37 + 0.18 + 0.09 + 0.04 + 0.02 + 0.01 + 0 + 0 + 0 +\u00a0\u2026</p>\n<p>The donations stop after the 11th person giving a total of \u00a323.87. Even if we had allowed donations of part of a penny the total would never quite reach \u00a324.00.

Credit: Shutterstock.</figcaption></figure><h4>Dr <a href=\"https://www.jenner.ac.uk/team/sean-elias\">Sean\u00a0Elias</a>\n</h4>\n<p>From 15th December all adults in the UK will be able to book a third booster jab to help combat the Omicron variant which has been shown to evade vaccine induced immunity. But why are we being asked to get a booster jab with a vaccine that isn\u2019t protecting us? Surely we need a new vaccine? The answer lies in the clever ways in which our immune system works, and in fact, a third dose of the original vaccine may not only protect us against Omicron, but be a better long-term strategy for combating future variants.</p>\n<p>It all comes down to how your immune system learns about new diseases. For your immune system seeing a new disease, or a vaccine designed to look a bit like the disease, it is a bit like you or I watching a film for the first time. There are vast amounts on new information for us to take in, including the plot, music, and who\u2019s in the cast\u2026 in many ways this information is similar to the active components within a\u00a0vaccine.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, you\u2019ll be able to recall some facts about the film, and I could test your knowledge with a quiz. The \u2018quiz\u2019 would determine how well you can recall the film\u2019s details, and is analogous to how your body\u2019s immune system recalls information about a virus from the information given by the vaccine, with a higher \u2018score\u2019 meaning a higher level of protective immunity. After watching the film once, you might be able to recall the basic plot, know that \u2018the butler did it\u2019, hum the main theme tune, and overall score reasonably well on the\u00a0quiz.</p>\n<p>Now, if you watched the same film a few weeks later, you might start noticing more clues earlier in the film, because you already know the overall plot. When given the same set of questions you can answer the ones you knew before much more quickly and armed with the newly noticed details, get a much higher score in our post-film quiz. This \u2018second watch\u2019 is like the second dose of the vaccine, and our immune system works much the same, responding quicker and on a greater\u00a0scale.</p>\n<p>Immune memory, much like our own memory, isn\u2019t perfect. Over time you\u2019ll probably forget some of the finer details of the film, as it isn\u2019t as fresh in your mind, so if I gave you my film quiz six months later your score would probably have dropped. Probably not as low as the quiz you did after you first watched the film, but not quite your\u00a0best.</p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s imagine that sometime later a remake is made of this film\u200a\u2014\u200alike the CGI version of the original animated <em>Lion King </em>film. It\u2019s basically the same film, but with a few updates, a new song and a slightly different cast.</p>\n<p>If you took my quiz about this new<strong> </strong>\u2018variant\u2019<strong> </strong>film\u200a\u2014\u200a<em>having only seen the original film twice 6 months ago\u200a\u2014\u200a</em>you would still have a good chance of scoring pretty well, and probably score better than someone who has only ever seen this new variant once. If you went back and watched the original again for a third time to boost your knowledge before the quiz on the new variant film you would likely do very well\u2026 well bar the questions on Beyonce\u2019s new song and the updated jokes for Timon and Pumba. But in all likelihood, on average you would probably score as well as someone who has never watched the original but has watched the new version a couple of\u00a0times.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when a film is remade (or a virus mutates) the updated \u2018variant\u2019 version is a completely new story, like the CGI version of <em>Dumbo </em>compared to the animated original. Now there are some details that cannot be changed which are integral to the identity or plot of the film (Dumbo is an elephant, and\u2026 spoiler alert\u2026 Dumbo flies). You will easily identify and answer questions based on these details, in the same way our immune system recognises parts of a virus that do not change, what scientists call \u2018conserved regions\u2019. Watching the original again will help you remember these details, however these questions only represent a small proportion of the quiz, so you may only realistically \u2018max out\u2019 at a pretty low score on my post-film quiz.</p>\n<p>To score well you need to watch the new film, in the same way we might need to think about making sure your immune system \u2018sees\u2019 a new viral variant, by developing an updated vaccine. Reassuringly, if we follow the same process, your immune system will build up knowledge and you\u2019ll be able to score well in my variant film quiz once\u00a0more.</p>\n<p>At this stage it is worth remembering that films are rebooted all the time, just as new viral variants arise all the time. Some stand the test of time whilst others fade into obscurity. Remember re-makes take time and money and there is no guarantee of success. Film writers often develop early scripts in the same way vaccine designers make early stage vaccines, but production only goes ahead once everyone is convinced it is the right time to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>Ultimately though it is often the classic version of a film and its beloved characters that we fall back on, that live long in our memories, bring us joy and allow us to have an opinion about whether newer versions are good or bad. In many ways our immune system is the same. The baseline knowledge provided full stop by vaccination with the original vaccine may prove to be what ultimately what protects us from serious disease, hospitalisation and death even if it isn\u2019t the \u2018perfect\u2019 vaccine for the variant that is currently dominating the box\u00a0office.</p>\n<h4>Related links</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jenner.ac.uk/\">The Jenner Institute</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/area/coronavirus-research/vaccine\">Oxford\u2019s Coronavirus Vaccine</a></p>\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n<p>Follow us here on Medium where we\u2019ll be publishing more articles\u00a0soon.</p>\n<p>Want to read more?
